<p>
  We're happy to announce this new release of XUMM to 0.5.1, containing well over 50 improvements and fixes.
  Although the version number indicates this is to be a minor release, the effort and changes are more like a
  major release. There are some important changes and fixes added to this release after we already communicated
  the version number.

  We have listened to your feedback and we will continue to do so. We appreciate your effort for making XUMM a
  better app everyday. Special thanks go out to <b>@NixerFFM</b> (Twitter), <b>@saschofield52</b> (Twitter)
  &amp; <b>Towo Labs</b> (xrptoolkit.com).
