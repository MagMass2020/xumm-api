  This (minor) update contains some improvements and addresses some minor bugs.
</p>

<h4>Improved</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Read Only accounts don't show the (confusing) "Request" button anymore at the home screen</li>
  <li>Added "keyboard incognito mode" for Android</li>
  <li>If the 'Account' field is specified in a Sign Request, that account is now preselected if present as Read/Write account</li>
  <li>Allow importing mnemonics from a QR code</li>
  <li>Add "exchange all funds" button in the "Other assets" (IOU) exchange screen</li>
</ul>

<h4>Changed</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Exchange accounts can not be imported as Read Only account anymore. Added a check for destination tag requirements when importing Read Only accounts, and don't allow users to import a Read Only account with mandatory (or likely) destination tag requirement, to prevent confusion.</li>
  <li>iOS FaceID / Fingerprint reader now falls back to OS passphrase/PIN on "Enter Password"</li>
  <li>Improved QR destination address recognition</li>
  <li>Updated push notification handling</li>
  <li>Changeed "passphrase" to "password" for XUMM account encryption/decryption (to prevent confusion with mnemonics)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Fixed</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Sign Requests (by URL) are now picked up from the clipboard when opening the app from background (minimized) state as well</li>
  <li>When you have an offer on the Decentralized Exchange, when a part of your offer is consumed, XUMM now shows only the affected amounts for the partial fill (instead of the entire consuming offer)</li>
  <li>On rare occasions the wrong currency exchange (IOU) amount was displayed in the transaction history (right amount was exchanged)</li>
  <li>Lots of decimal places are now truncated in the Exchange (IOU) screen</li>
  <li>Fixed app crash on scanning a Coinbase destination QR code</li>
  <li>Fixed Android app crash on empty asset list</li>
</ul>
